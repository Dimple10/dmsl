This respository contains all of the scripts needed to perform the analysis and
create the plots from Pardo & Dor√© (2021) (LINK TBA).

The [`dmsl/`](dmsl/) directory contains the main calculation scripts.

The [`drivers/`](drivers/) directory contains the scripts that make all
of the plots and perform the analyses.

To run the scripts for yourself, uncomment the analysis types you'd like in [`run_analysis.py`](drivers/run_analysis.py). Then run the scripts for any plots you want to make. You can also add your own lens profiles in [`mass_profile.py`](dmsl/mass_profile.py) or your own surveys in [`survey.py`](dmsl/survey.py).
